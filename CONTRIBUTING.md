### Creating New Agents

Want to add a new agent to the 20-agent system design?

**Requirements:**
1. **Follows existing pattern** - Use AGENTS-REFERENCE.md as template
2. **Solves real problem** - Based on actual React Native pain points
3. **Well-documented** - Clear description, examples, use cases
4. **Tested** - Works on real Expo/React Native projects

**Agent File Structure:**
```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Specific description of when to invoke (be precise for auto-invocation)
tools: Read, Grep, Edit  # Only tools actually needed
model: sonnet  # haiku/sonnet/opus based on complexity
---

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] **Test thoroughly** - Verify installation script works
- [ ] **Update documentation** - README, guides, etc.
- [ ] **Follow coding standards** (see below)
- [ ] **Add examples** - Show how new feature works
- [ ] **Check for typos** - Proofread your changes

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commits style:

- `feat: Add bundle-size-assassin agent`
- `fix: Installer handles paths with spaces`
- `docs: Improve installation instructions`
- `refactor: Simplify agent detection logic`
- `test: Add validation for custom commands`

### PR Description

Include:
1. **What** - What does this PR do?
2. **Why** - Why is this change needed?
3. **How** - How does it work?
4. **Testing** - How did you test it?
5. **Screenshots** (if applicable)

**Example:**
```markdown
## What
Adds the Bundle Size Assassin agent to detect and optimize large imports.

## Why
Bundle size is a critical issue for React Native apps. This agent catches:
- Full lodash imports (should use lodash-es)
- Large moment.js (suggest day.js alternative)
- Duplicate dependencies

## How
- Created agent file: ready-to-use/agents/tier-3-specialized/bundle-assassin.md
- Uses Bash tool to run `npx react-native-bundle-visualizer`
- Parses output and suggests optimizations

## Testing
- Tested on 3 Expo projects (SDK 50, 51, 52)
- Detected 4/4 known bundle size issues
- Suggestions were actionable and correct
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### PowerShell Scripts

```powershell
# ‚úÖ DO: Use clear variable names
$projectRoot = Get-Location

# ‚úÖ DO: Add error handling
try {
    Copy-Item -Path $source -Destination $dest -Force
} catch {
    Write-Host "[ERROR] Failed to copy: $_" -ForegroundColor Red
    exit 1
}

# ‚úÖ DO: Use consistent colors
Write-Host "[OK] Success" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "[WARN] Warning" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "[ERROR] Error" -ForegroundColor Red

# ‚ùå DON'T: Hardcode paths
$path = "C:\Users\Senai\..."  # BAD

# ‚ùå DON'T: Skip error handling
Copy-Item ...  # No try/catch - BAD
```

### Agent Files (Markdown + YAML)

```markdown
# ‚úÖ DO: Be specific in description
---
description: Validates React Native components for missing accessibilityLabel, accessibilityRole, and touch target size (44x44) according to WCAG 2.2
---

# ‚ùå DON'T: Be vague
---
description: Checks accessibility
---

# ‚úÖ DO: Only include needed tools
---
tools: Read, Grep
---

# ‚ùå DON'T: Include all tools
---
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash, Task, WebFetch  # Overkill
---
```

### Documentation

- Use **clear headings** with emoji (consistent with existing docs)
- Include **code examples** with syntax highlighting
- Add **real-world scenarios** when possible
- Keep **line length < 120 characters** for readability
- Use **markdown tables** for comparisons

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, test:

#### For Installation Script Changes:
- [ ] **Fresh install** - Delete `.claude/` and reinstall
- [ ] **Project-scoped install** - Run from Expo project root
- [ ] **Global install** - Install to `~/.claude/`
- [ ] **Interactive mode** - Test prompts and user input
- [ ] **Non-interactive mode** - Test `-Scope` parameter
- [ ] **Error handling** - Test with missing package.json, invalid paths

#### For Agent Changes:
- [ ] **Auto-invocation** - Does it trigger automatically?
- [ ] **Manual invocation** - Does `@agent-name` work?
- [ ] **Correct output** - Are suggestions accurate?
- [ ] **Edge cases** - Test with unusual project structures
- [ ] **Performance** - Response time < 30 seconds?

#### For Documentation:
- [ ] **Links work** - All internal links navigate correctly
