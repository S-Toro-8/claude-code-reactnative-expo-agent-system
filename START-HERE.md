# 🚀 START HERE - Claude Code Agent System for Expo/React Native

> **🌟 Created by SenaiVerse**
> *Claude Code Agent System for Expo/React Native Development*

---

**Welcome!** You're 10 minutes away from having 20 AI agents working for you.

---

## ⚡ Quick Setup (Windows)

### Step 1: Verify Your Setup (30 seconds)

Open your terminal in Cursor and run:

```bash
claude --version
```

✅ Should show: `2.0.5` (or similar)

---

### Step 2: Install Agents (2 minutes)

**🎯 Recommended: Interactive Mode** (Easiest!)

Just run the installer and it will guide you:

```powershell
# Navigate to scripts folder
cd ~/claude-code-expo-system/scripts

# Run the installer (it will ask you: Project or Global?)
.\install-agents.ps1
```

**What happens:**
1. **Menu appears:** Choose "1" for Project-scoped or "2" for Global
2. **If Project:** Scans for `package.json`, shows results, asks confirmation
3. **Installs:** Copies agents to the chosen location

---

**Advanced: Non-Interactive Mode** (Skip Prompts)

For automation or if you know exactly what you want:

**Option A: Project-Scoped (Recommended for Teams)**

Agents installed in your project's `.claude/` folder - version controlled & team-shared.

```powershell
# Navigate to YOUR Expo/React Native project first
cd C:\path\to\your\expo-project

# Force project scope (no prompts)
~/claude-code-expo-system/scripts/install-agents.ps1 -Scope project
```

**Option B: Global (Personal Use)**

Agents installed in `~/.claude/` - available in ALL projects.

```powershell
# Force global scope (no prompts)
cd ~/claude-code-expo-system/scripts
.\install-agents.ps1 -Scope global
```

**Option C: Manual Installation**

```bash
# Project-scoped (run from your project root)
cp -r ready-to-use/agents/* ./.claude/agents/
cp -r ready-to-use/commands/* ./.claude/commands/
cp ready-to-use/templates/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md

# OR Global (available everywhere)
cp -r ready-to-use/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
cp -r ready-to-use/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp ready-to-use/templates/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Project Context (1 minute)

**If you used project-scoped installation:** CLAUDE.md was automatically copied to your project root!

**If you used global installation:** Copy CLAUDE.md manually:

```bash
# Copy the CLAUDE.md template
cp ready-to-use/templates/CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/expo-project/CLAUDE.md
```

**Next:** Edit `CLAUDE.md` with your project specifics (framework versions, conventions, etc.)

---

### Step 4: Test It Works (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to your Expo project
cd /path/to/your/expo-project

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Try invoking an agent
> Can you review this project's accessibility compliance?
```

Claude should automatically invoke the **A11y Compliance Enforcer** agent.

## 📖 Next Steps

1. ✅ **You are here** - Setup complete
2. 📘 Read `COMPLETE-GUIDE.md` - Understand the system deeply
3. 🔧 Customize agents - Edit files in `ready-to-use/agents/`
4. 📊 Track impact - Use the metrics dashboard (coming soon)
5. 👥 Share with team - See collaboration guide in docs

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Agent not found"
```bash
# Verify agents are installed
ls ~/.claude/agents/
```

### "Permission denied" (Windows)
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### "Agents not auto-invoking"
- Check agent descriptions are clear
- Manually invoke: `@agent-name`
- See troubleshooting guide in `COMPLETE-GUIDE.md`

### "Command not working in Windows"
- Use Git Bash or WSL if PowerShell has issues
- See `docs/windows-setup.md` for detailed instructions

## 💡 Pro Tips

**🔥 Enable hooks for automation**
```bash
# Copy hook configurations
cp ready-to-use/hooks/* ~/.claude/
```

**📈 Start with the "Practical 5" combo**
```
1. Design Token Guardian (visual consistency)
2. A11y Compliance Enforcer (legal requirement)
3. Smart Test Generator (bug prevention)
4. Version Compatibility Shield (save time)
5. Performance Budget Enforcer (user experience)
```

**🎓 Learn progressively**
- Week 1: Use 3-5 agents
- Week 2: Add hooks + automation
- Week 3: Multi-agent workflows
- Week 4: Create custom agents

**🎯 Understanding Scope Precedence**

Claude Code checks for agents in this order (highest to lowest priority):
1. **Project agents** (`.claude/agents/` in your project)
2. **Global agents** (`~/.claude/agents/` in your home directory)

This means:
- Project agents **override** global agents with the same name
- You can have BOTH: project-specific + global personal agents
- Teams should use project-scoped (shared via git)
- Personal agents can stay global

---

## 📊 Expected Results

After setup, you should see:
- ✅ Agents auto-invoked based on context
- ✅ Slash commands available in Claude Code
- ✅ Hooks running automatically (if enabled)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md context in every conversation

**Time savings reported by users:**

- 35% fewer production bugs
- 80% less time on code reviews
- 60% faster onboarding for new developers
